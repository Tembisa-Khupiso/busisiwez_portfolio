        <p class="w3-justify"> My name is Busisiwe Mhlotshazana. I am a 24 year old, born and bred in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am the first born of three and there's a "thing" first born kids being "DEPUTY PARENTS" and I can say that I can relate. Being the first born has taught me a lot about responsibility and leadership. There are many things I value,family being one of them. I was raised by both my parents and even though there were ups and downs, they managed to raise my siblings and I in a warm and loving environment.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="w3-justify">I attended primary school at Rosettenville Primary School. I was a bubbly child growing up and I made friends easily. I was part of the netball team from grade 1 to grade 7. I  was also part of the Eistoddfod team and that is where i gained my experience and love for public speaking.Kenilworth High School, formally known as Kenilworth Junior Secondary School, is where I joined the debate team and grew in my public speaking skill. I then went to Hoerskool Die Fakkel where I completed the rest of my high school grades because Kenilworth Junior Secondary School only had Grades 8 and 9. The transition from a small school to a bigger one was unusual for me at first. For two years, I was in this small comfortable cocoon and had to go to a place where there are three times as many people as im used to seeing. I eventually adapted to this new environment, I did a bit of debate and netball.</p>

        <h1>Work and Academics</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I went to the London School of Business in Braamfontein where i acquired my Level 4 certificate in Business Management. I knew that was not what I wanted to do. I applied at Boston Media House and completed my BBA in Media Operations Management in 2018. After being unemployed for a couple of months I heard about Umuzi from a friend of mine and I applied for the UX/Strategy department and got in. I would like to grow at Umuzi and in this department by acquiring additional skills. I would also like to open a Beauty Palour that offers nail,hair and make-up services. I would use my UX and HCD knowledge  to differentiate ourselves and enhance our services. I have also started developing a marketing strategy for a new restuarant in Maboneng</p>

        <h1>Beauty and Fashion</h1>
        <br>
        <p>As a child, i grew up playing with Barbie dolls and they playsets would come with little lipsticks and eyeshadow palettes. Being the typical girlie girl,my love for fashion and beauty started when my mother started allowing me to pick my own clothes and put together my own outfits.I would sometimes play with my my nother's make-up and I was fascinated by the colours on my face.Over the years, my taste in fashion has changed and I do not have one sense of style.I love streetwear just as much as I love haute couture. I'm not a designer nor am i a stylist but i love watching fashion documentaries. I also watch make-up tutorials all the time where I have learnt all sorts of make-up technics. I love downloading outfit inspiration pictures and videos.</p>

        <p>For me,lifestyle only became something i was interested in... when i started high school. I started developing a taste for music,travel,food and fashion. Channels  like E! Entertainment, Vuzu,TLC Entertainment as well as social media influence my interest in pop culture and lifestyle.</p>
